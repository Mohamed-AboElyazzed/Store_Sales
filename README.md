# Store Sales Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a store sales dataset to derive insights and create forecasts for better decision-making. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, forecasting, and visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Project Steps

### Week 1: Data Preprocessing

Tasks:

Load the dataset and clean it by handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

Convert date columns to datetime format for easier analysis.

Drop irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset.

Tools Used: Python (pandas, matplotlib).

Deliverables:

Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing steps.

### Week 2: Analysis Questions

Tasks:

Identify key analysis questions relevant to stakeholders, such as:

What is the impact of product categories and regions on sales performance?

Which segments and cities have the highest sales?

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer these questions.

Tools Used: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).

Deliverables:

A set of analysis questions and answers.

Visualizations of key insights.

### Week 3: Forecasting Questions

Tasks:

Develop forecasting models to predict future sales trends.

Use machine learning libraries like scikit-learn to implement models.

Create visualizations to showcase trends and predictions.

Tools Used: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

Deliverables:

Visualizations answering forecasting questions.

Predictions of future sales trends.

### Week 4: Visualization and Final Presentation

Tasks:

Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to present insights and forecasts.

Create a comprehensive final report and presentation summarizing the project.

Tools Used: Tableau, Python (for initial visualization preparation).

## Deliverables:

Tableau dashboard with key insights.

Final report and presentation.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on store sales, including:

Order details (e.g., Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date)

Customer and segment information

Product details (e.g., Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Sales)

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

For Tableau, download the Tableau Desktop application from Tableau.
